# Security Monitoring System
This project is a simple security monitoring system that uses a webcam to detect unwanted objects or intruders in a scene. It captures live video feed from the webcam and compares it with a reference background image to detect changes using OpenCV's background subtraction concept. If an intruder is detected, the system alerts the authorities.
